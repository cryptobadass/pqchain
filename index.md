# 1. The Problem

1. Existing Blockchains at Risk of Quantum Attacks
2. Blockchains are Low Throughput and Non-Scalable
3. Blockchain Transactions Compromise Privacy

# 2. Our Solution

A quantum-resistant, high-throughput, privacy-by-default and regulatory friendly blockchain that solves the main problems of the existing blockchain technology, unlocking its full potential while gaining public acceptance.

# 3. Our Blockchain

1. Secured for the next 50 years of quantum computing era
2. Processes up to 60,000 transactions per second
3. Supports HFT financial trading, and large scale web2 apps
4. Makes privacy by default and regulatory friendly

# 4. Our Proposition

## 4.1. Quantum-resistant

We use CRYSTAL-Dilithium, a lattice based, high performance DSA that provides quantum-robustness.

## 4.2. Privacy-by-default

We preserve transaction privacy using lattice-based zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) primitives to mask its information while still letting the entire network to verify its legitimacy.

## 4.3. Revolutionary Technology

We push the research and technology forefronts in the quest of building a blockchain: post-quantum cryptography, high throughput consensus protocol, privacy features, and PQ ZK virtual machine.

## 4.4. High-throughput

An optimized Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Protocol, MIR BFT that achieves high throughput.

## 4.5. Virtual Machine

We provide a Virtual Machine (VM) allowing developers to program any business logic imaginable, enabling its application possibilities in both crypto and traditional industries.

- A PQ blockchain built with the highest-security level
- DSA CRYSTAL-Dilithium as 1st candidate, Falcon as 2nd
- High throughput via MIR-BFT consensus protocol
- Transaction privacy via ZKP constructed on Dilithium or Falcon
- Virtual Machine (VM) zkWASM for programming arbitrary business logic
- Regulatory compliance with encryption/decryption of specific data and meta data
