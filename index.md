# 1. The problems in today's blockchain

1. Not quantum secure
2. Low throughput, no scalablility
3. No privacy
4. No compliance

# 2. The solution

A new public blockchain that is quantum-resistant, high throughput, privacy by default, and regulatory friendly.

# 3. The goal

1. Maintain security over the next 50 years of quantum computing progression.
2. Process ~60,000 TPS, supports high frequency trading and large scale web2 apps.

# 4. The building blocks

1. **Quantum security:** by CRYSTAL-Dilithium, a lattice based, high performance digital signature algorithm.

2. **Transaction privacy:** by lattice-based zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) primitives to mask the transaction information.

3. **High throughput:** by an optimized Byzantine Fault Tolerant Protocol that produce blocks by multiple leaders in parallel.

4. **Programmability:** by a zk-friendly virtual machine (zkWASM) that allows developers to write arbitrary application logic with the programming language they prefer: C, C++, Java, Rust, and even Solidity.

5. **Compliance:** by compressing and encrypting transaction data (and meta data) and allow identity based threshold decrypting (Multi Party Computation for encryption and decryption).

# 5. The whitepaper (work in progress)
