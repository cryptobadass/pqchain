# The problems

Current blockchains are:

1. Not quantum secure
2. Low throughput, no scalablility
3. No privacy
4. No compliance

# The solution

A new public blockchain that is:

1. quantum-resistant
2. high throughput
3. privacy preserving
4. compliance

# The goal

1. Maintain security over the next 50 years of quantum computing progression.
2. Process ~60,000 TPS, supports high frequency trading and large scale web2 apps.

# The building blocks

**Quantum security:**

CRYSTAL-Dilithium, a lattice based, high performance DSA.

**Transaction privacy:**

Lattice-based zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).

**High throughput:**

Parallelized Byzantine Fault Tolerant Protocol.

**Programmability:**

Zk-friendly virtual machine (zkWASM) that allow developers to write arbitrary application logic with any programming languages: C, C++, Java, Rust, Solidity etc.

**Compliance:**

Encrypting transaction data (and meta data) and allow identity based threshold decrypting (Multi Party Computation for encryption and decryption).
